            <p>
                The <i>Cottage garden</i> is a dinstinct style of garden that
                uses an informal design, dense plantings, and a
                mixture of ornamental and edible plants
            </p> 
            <p>
                The cottage Garden originated in <u>England</u> and its
                history can be traced back for centuries, although
                they were re-invented in 1870's England, when
                stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the
                more structured and regorously maintained <u>Engligh
                estate gardens</u>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The earliest cottage gardens were more practical
                than their modern desendants, with an emphasis 
                on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.
